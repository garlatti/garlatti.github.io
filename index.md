# Introduction

Website written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
to describe the new life of a very busy retired guy. The responsive Jekyll theme 
used to design the website is called [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/).
