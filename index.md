#  The West Wood Workshop

## Introduction

The website is aiming at describing woodworking projects, 
the workshop organization and the different tools used in projects. 

__Most images are also hyperlinks to full size images.__

The Website is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  with 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)  and powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ,
to describe the new life of a very busy retired guy. The responsive Jekyll theme 
used to design the website is called [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/).
