# Carpentry Layout

In the workshop, the tool storage is based on the french cleat system.
The French cleat system is a versatile way to organize tools and accessories
on the workshop. It offers unlimited possibilities and storage space for tools 
and materials of all kinds that you can move as you want, 
according to your different needs. Thus, it enables you to keep your workspace tidy and 
well-organized. 

It is a simple bracket made with interlocking 45 degree angles.
In other words, it uses near-flat vertical lengths of timber with a 45-degree
angle cut. These angled cuts allow you to hook on accessories that have a 
compatible 45-degree hook attached,

 Some pictures of the french cleat system in my workshop.

* The first one - on the left - is a Machine Table MASTER cut 2600 - Wolfcraft. It is a  multifunctional machine table
  
    * for use as a circular saw bench, jigsaw table, mitre saw table, work station, and optionally as a milling table 
    and a station for guided circular saws
  
    * machine plate with safety lock, compatible with many commercially available tools
    * mobile use possible; can be folded for space-saving, free-standing storage

* The second one is a very simple DIY workbench based on two trestles. 
The next step is to design and build a "true" modern workbench. 

The two workbenches are put on a tray with castors to move them easily 
and to get the right height - the same one for the two. 

A new workbench has been designed and built recently - shown below. 
The DIY MFT Workbench is inspired by the [Flokard's and /Piroky's workbench](https://www.lairdubois.fr/plans/2403-etabli-flokard-piroky-pdf-et-skp-par-swann-wild.html). One workbench is on a tray with castors and the other one is on castors to move them easily 
and to get the right height - the same one for the two. More details are given in the project "New Workbench".
