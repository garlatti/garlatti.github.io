# Tool Holders

Once you build a French Cleat tool wall, you need to start adding 
tool holders and tools. Most tool holders take less than 20 minutes 
to build. Have fun and don’t be afraid to toss your failures and 
try again. Here are tips to help you build your wall and make 
custom holders for your tools and gear.

Small shelf supports
Small Shelves can get by with minimal support. 
They’ll only need vertical supports that cover one wall cleat.

Medium-size shelves
Medium-Size shelves, depending on their design and the weight 
of their contents, may need to span more than one cleat

Choose hooks, racks and shelf brackets and build components to suit them.
